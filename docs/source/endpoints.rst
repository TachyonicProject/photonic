Endpoints
=========

Introduction
------------

Endpoints are like applications/systems that you create on your end and then plug them into the Photonic web interface to monitor and view those applications. 

Usage
-----
An Endpoints usage can be whatever you design it for. This will thus differ from endpoint to endpoint.


Creating/Adding Endpoints
-------------------------
To create a new *Endpoint*, navigate to ``System -> Endpoints`` and click on the ``Add Endpoint`` button. This will launch
the *Add Endpoint* form.

Simply enter the *Endpoint* name. After that you will be able to select the interface type, Public, Internal or Admin. You will aslso need to add a Region. Lastly you will need to add a URI otherwise you will not be able to add a Endpoint.

Selecting interface type.


Viewing Endpoints
-----------------
In order to view *Domain* information, navigate to ``System -> Endpoints``, and click on the magnifying glass icon.
This will launch the *View Endpoints* window, which will display the current information associated with the *Endpoints*.

In the above example there is no endpoints as example, but if you have created endpoints the endpoints will pop up here and will then be seen in the above list were you can then select a specific endpoint and view the associated information.


Modifying Endpoints information 
-------------------------------
In order to update the Endpoint name, or edit other information, follow the same procedure as in :ref:`viewendpoint`, and click on
the ``edit`` button. This will launch the *Edit Endpoint* window. Update the information accordingly, and hit the ``Save`` button.

Deleting Endpoints
------------------
In order to delete a *Endpoint*, follow the same procedure as in :ref:`editendpoint`, and click on
the ``delete`` button. A confirmation dialog will pop up. Hit the ``Continue`` button to permanently delete the domain,
or hit ``Cancel`` to return to the previous form.
